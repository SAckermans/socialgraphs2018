Generate 50 networks with $N = 500$, $\\langle k \\rangle = 4$, for each of $p = \\{0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2\\}$. Calculate the average of $\\langle d \\rangle$ as well as the standard deviation over the 50 networks, to create a plot that shows how the path length decreases very quickly with only a little fraction of re-wiring. Use the standard deviation to add errorbars to the plot. My version of the plot is below (since a picture's worth 1000 words).\n",

    "Next step is to explore the [Friendship paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship_paradox). This paradox states that _almost everyone_ have fewer friends than their friends have, on average. This sounds crazy, but is actually an almost trivial consequence of living in a social network with a power-law degree distribution. The explanation is that almost everyone is friends with a hub, that drives up the average degree of the friends. Let's explore that in the 5000 node BA network we've just generated. Do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pick a node _i_ at random (e.g. use `random.choice`). [Find its degree](http://networkx.lanl.gov/reference/generated/networkx.Graph.degree.html).\n",
